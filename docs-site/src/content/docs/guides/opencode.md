description: Use any routed model from opencode — OpenProvider injects a runtime provider block and leaves your own opencode config untouched.
---

opencode reads its providers from merged JSON config layers rather than environment
variables, so there is no `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`-style slot to inject. `opr opencode`
bridges that gap: it ensures the proxy is running, builds a provider block from the
visible catalog, and injects it through OpenCode's inline runtime layer
(`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`).

## Quickstart

```bash
opr opencode
```

This ensures the proxy is running and launches opencode with only the generated
`provider.OpenProvider` block injected for that process. Extra arguments pass through:
`opr opencode run "hello"`.

Routed models appear in the picker under the `OpenProvider` provider:

```text
OpenProvider/kiro/glm-5
OpenProvider/gpt-5.6-sol      # native slugs stay unprefixed
```

## Your own config is never modified

The launcher does not copy or rewrite `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`,
project `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc`, or any other on-disk config layer. It may
read global or project config to detect a `provider.OpenProvider` override, while your
existing providers, agents, keybinds, MCP entries, and relative `{file:…}` references
keep resolving from their original files.

For this launch only, OpenProvider adds the generated `provider.OpenProvider` block through
OpenCode's inline runtime layer. That layer merges after global/custom/project config
and overrides only conflicting keys for the child process.

| Layer | Behavior with `opr opencode` |
| --- | --- |
| Global / custom / project config | Left on disk exactly as you wrote it |
| Inline runtime (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`) | Receives only the generated `provider.OpenProvider` block |
| Relative `{file:…}` paths | Still resolve against the config file that originally defined them |

If a global or project config also defines `provider.OpenProvider`, the launcher prints an
informational note: the runtime layer from `opr opencode` overrides it for that launch.

## The admission key is not written to disk

When the proxy requires an API key, the inline runtime config carries opencode's
`{env:…}` reference rather than the secret. Loopback binds use that reference as
`apiKey`; non-loopback binds send it only through `x-OpenProvider-api-key` so proxy
admission stays separate from any upstream `Authorization` header.

Loopback example:

```json
"options": {
  "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:10100/v1",
  "apiKey": "{env:OpenProvider_OPENCODE_API_KEY}"
}
```

Non-loopback example:

```json
"options": {
  "baseURL": "http://192.168.1.10:10100/v1",
  "headers": {
    "x-OpenProvider-api-key": "{env:OpenProvider_OPENCODE_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

The real value is passed only through the child process environment.
`OpenProvider_API_AUTH_TOKEN` takes precedence, then the hardened service token file, then
a configured API key — which is what a non-loopback bind requires.

## Reverting

Nothing to undo — no generated config file is written under `~/.OpenProvider`. Run plain
`opencode` and it reads your own config exactly as before.

## Model limits

`limit.context` is written only when the catalog reports an authoritative context window; when it
does not, the whole `limit` block is omitted and opencode keeps its own defaults.

opencode's schema rejects a `limit` block carrying `context` without `output`, and the catalog has
no authoritative per-model output field, so an `output` budget of `32000` is emitted alongside it,
clamped down to the context window so a small-context model is never given `output > context`.
That figure exists to satisfy the schema — it is not a claim about any specific model's true
maximum.

The `OpenProvider` provider block is regenerated on every launch, so per-model tweaks made inside it
will not survive. Keep custom entries under a provider key of your own instead.

## Requirements

opencode must be installed and on `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-ai
```
