# openprovider Structure

This folder is the maintainer source of truth for the current system shape. Public user workflows
belong in `docs-site/`; historical investigations belong in `docs/`.

## Product boundary

openprovider is a local Responses-compatible proxy for Codex. It does not patch Codex binaries. It
changes local Codex state by writing a provider table and model catalog, then serves:

```text
Codex CLI / TUI / App / SDK
  -> http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1/responses
  -> openprovider routing + adapter bridge
  -> upstream provider
```

The default install keeps native OpenAI/ChatGPT passthrough working through one option-aware
`openai` provider. Pool is the default and selects across main plus added accounts; Direct uses only
the current caller/main login. `openai-apikey` explicitly selects API-key transport, and the two
credential routes never fall through into one another. Built-in provider presets include Anthropic,
Google, Azure, Neuralwatt Cloud, Tencent Cloud Coding Plan, and SiliconFlow. Additional
providers are routed by explicit `provider/model`, provider model lists, or the configured
`defaultProvider`.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Add two widely used API-key providers through the canonical registry so CLI, GUI, login, routing, and documentation remain in parity.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: Tencent Coding Plan is OpenAI-compatible but contractually restricted to interactive coding tools and has a dynamic, text-only model set. SiliconFlow exposes a dynamic OpenAI-compatible catalog whose reasoning controls vary by model.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Treat both as custom providers only; freeze a large SiliconFlow model list and reasoning map; expose Tencent without a usage warning.
- 선택한 방식: Add registry-derived key presets, keep live discovery enabled, seed only Tencent's currently documented coding-plan models, and surface Tencent's usage restriction in both the preset note and public docs.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: Registry presets remove setup friction while live discovery avoids claiming that mutable catalogs are permanent. Avoiding speculative SiliconFlow reasoning metadata prevents invalid vendor-specific parameters.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Both providers appear consistently across supported setup surfaces. Tencent users receive an explicit policy warning; SiliconFlow reasoning controls remain conservative until model-specific limits can be represented safely.

## Local state

| Path | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.openprovider/config.json` | openprovider | Main config written by `opr init` and the dashboard. |
| `~/.openprovider/auth.json` | openprovider | OAuth tokens; not committed. Multiauth shape: `provider -> { activeAccountId, accounts[] }` (legacy single-credential values normalize on load; a one-time `auth.json.pre-multiauth` backup guards downgrades). ChatGPT scratch OAuth stays separate from the Codex account store; identity-less providers (kimi/kiro/cursor) replace their active slot. |
| `~/.openprovider/codex-accounts.json` | openprovider | Hardened main-plus-added credential store used by `openai` in Pool mode. |
| `~/.openprovider/catalog-backup.json` | openprovider | One-time pristine Codex catalog backup for restore. |
| `~/.openprovider/usage.jsonl` | openprovider | Append-only request usage log (0o600); request metadata + token counts only, never prompts or auth. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` | Codex, edited by openprovider | Active provider and provider table. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/openprovider.config.toml` | openprovider | Optional profile for explicit Codex opt-in. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/openprovider-catalog.json` | openprovider | Shared native+routed model catalog. |
| `$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json` | Codex, invalidated by openprovider | Cache invalidated after model/catalog changes. |
| `dist/`, `gui/dist/`, `node_modules/` | generated | Build output/dependencies. |

## Non-negotiable invariants

- `websockets` defaults to `false`; only `true` advertises `supports_websockets`.
- `CODEX_HOME` wins over `~/.codex` when present and valid.
- Root TOML keys such as `model_provider` and `model_catalog_json` must stay before any table.
- Routed model slugs use `provider/model`.
- OpenAI has one `openai` Codex-login provider with Pool(default)/Direct modes and a separate `openai-apikey`; see [`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md).
- Codex `spawn_agent` visibility depends on the first five featured catalog entries.
- `opr stop`, `opr restore`, and service stop/uninstall must leave native Codex usable.

## Writing rule

Keep this directory flat. Add or extend lexicographically ordered `NN_topic.md` files; do not add
subdirectories. If one file grows too broad, split the next stable topic into the next unused number
instead of creating nested folders.
