# GUI And Management API SOT

## Dashboard serving

The bundled React dashboard is built into `gui/dist` and served by the same Bun proxy. `ocx gui`
starts the proxy when needed and opens `http://localhost:<port>`.

## API ownership

`src/server/index.ts` authenticates and routes `/api/*`, then delegates the management surface to
`src/server/management-api.ts`:

| Endpoint area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Config/settings | Read safe config/settings views; mutate supported settings only. Full `PUT /api/config` is disabled so masked secrets are not round-tripped. `PUT /api/settings` accepts `codexAutoStart` and/or `streamMode` (each optional, at least one required); `streamMode` persists the #314 stream-shape selection in config.json because Windows services do not inherit shell env. |
| Startup safety | `GET /api/startup-health` reports whether injected Codex routing is restart-safe, with secret-free service/shim diagnostics. `POST /api/startup-action` provides allowlisted one-click installation for the background service or launcher shim. On Windows a healthy script shim is CLI-only; Codex Desktop requires the background service for full protection. |
| Windows tray | `GET/POST /api/windows-tray` controls an owned, per-user HKCU login tray. The tray delegates fixed actions to the CLI and is never a proxy supervisor or restart-protection signal. |
| Updates | `GET /api/update/check`, `POST /api/update/run`, and `GET /api/update/status` own dashboard self-update state. A launched worker PID is persisted in `update-job.json`; dead PIDs recover immediately, while legacy active records without a PID recover only after ten minutes. Live PIDs remain exclusive regardless of record age. |
| Providers | Create/update/delete ordinary provider configs and enrich registry metadata. The reserved `openai` card exposes Pool(default)/Direct account mode; `openai-apikey` remains the separate API route. |
| Models | Fetch routed model lists, disabled model visibility, and catalog-facing ids. |
| OAuth | Login/status/logout for OAuth-backed providers, plus multiauth account management: `GET /api/oauth/accounts`, `PUT /api/oauth/accounts/active`, `PUT /api/oauth/accounts/alias`, `DELETE /api/oauth/accounts` list masked accounts per provider, switch the active one, edit its display-only alias, and remove one. Login accepts `addAccount: true` to force a fresh browser identity. Device flows return a structured `deviceCode`; the GUI highlights and copies it before the user opens the verification page. |
| Key providers | Expose API-key provider presets for setup and dashboard flows. Multi-key pool per key-auth provider: `GET /api/providers/keys`, `POST /api/providers/keys`, `PUT /api/providers/keys/active`, `PUT /api/providers/keys/alias`, `DELETE /api/providers/keys` masked list, add (upsert + activate), switch, rename, and remove keys. `provider.apiKey` always mirrors the active pool entry so routing stays single-key. |
| OpenAI account mode | Report one OpenAI Codex card with Pool/Direct controls and one API-key card. Mode PATCH persists live without restart or catalog identity changes; Pool owns account/quota controls and Direct uses caller/main login only. Main-account DTOs report real credential presence and terminal `needsReauth` state instead of treating missing/invalid native auth as an unknown quota. |
| Subagents | Read/write the featured `subagentModels` list capped at five ids. `GET/PUT /api/injection-model` manages the shared delegation model/effort selection, the independent OpenCodex guidance switch, and the default-off `syncCodexSubagentDefaults` opt-in for native Codex subagent defaults. When OpenCodex owns the active Codex routing, native `[agents]` defaults apply to newly created Codex tasks after sync/restart; external user-managed provider configs remain untouched. The defaults do not cause delegation and preserve existing user-owned defaults rather than overwriting them. PUT is partial-update: absent keys are unchanged, `null` clears, and non-object bodies are rejected with 400 before field validation. `syncCodexSubagentDefaults: true` requires a nonblank `model` and a supported Codex reasoning effort when effort is set; clearing `model` (null/empty) always clears effort and disables native-default sync even when the stored effort was invalid. |
| V2 / Multi-agent mode | `GET/PUT /api/v2` — reports/sets the codex `multi_agent_v2` feature flag, the 3-state `multiAgentMode` override (`v1`/`default`/`v2`), and the logical maximum thread count. Selecting `v2` enables the native flag and migrates `[agents] max_threads` to the v2 key; selecting `v1` disables it and migrates the same value back. `default` leaves the native flag unchanged. PUT accepts `enabled`, `multiAgentMode`, and/or the compatibility-named `maxConcurrentThreadsPerSession`; contradictory mode/flag pairs are rejected before writes. Every transition is rollback-safe and resyncs the catalog. |
| Logs & Debug | One sidebar entry (`/#logs`) with two tabs. Logs tab: request/runtime logs for local diagnosis. Debug tab (`/#logs/debug`; legacy `/#debug` deep links redirect there): provider + usage toggles, refresh/follow log viewer. `GET/PUT /api/debug`; `GET /api/debug/logs` and `GET /api/debug/usage-logs` (monotonic `after` cursor, legacy `since` accepted). CLI: `ocx debug provider|usage …` (both streams via running proxy API). |
| Usage | `GET /api/usage` aggregate read-only summary derived from `~/.opencodex/usage.jsonl`; measured / reported / unreported / unsupported / estimated counts, daily zero-filled grid, model and provider breakdowns. Never exposes prompts. |
| System | `GET /api/system/memory` — service-process runtime/memory identity (pid, Bun version/revision, platform, RSS/heap/external/ArrayBuffers scalars, observed memory = max(RSS, external, ArrayBuffers), `bun:jsc` heap context, streamMode + eager-relay gate decision, watchdog snapshot sliced to the last 60 samples). Scalar-only payload; rides the standard management auth gate and must never move to unauthenticated `/healthz`. Consumed by `ocx doctor`'s Memory/runtime section and the dashboard Memory observability card. |
| Stop | `POST /api/stop` — restore native Codex, stop any installed service, and exit the proxy. |

Provider writes must not round-trip masked API keys as real secrets. Dashboard actions that change
model visibility or subagent selection should trigger catalog/cache sync behavior through the server
path that owns it.

The UI must show one provider card and one Models group for Codex-login OpenAI, describe Pool and
Direct accurately, and keep the main account inside Pool. Public model state keeps virtual Pro ids
even though transport logs may additionally report the resolved base model. Detailed rules live in
[`08_openai-provider-tiers.md`](08_openai-provider-tiers.md).

User aliases are display metadata only. Codex pool aliases live on `CodexAccount`, OAuth aliases on
`ProviderAccount`, and API-key aliases reuse the existing key `label`; account ids, credential
identity, active selection, and routing never consult these fields. The matching CLI is
`ocx account alias <provider> <id> <display-name|->` (`rename` is accepted as a synonym).

## Sidebar stop button

The dashboard sidebar includes a stop button that calls `POST /api/stop`. The button shows a
confirmation prompt, then fires the request and accepts the connection drop (the proxy exits). The
endpoint restores native Codex config, stops any installed service to prevent respawn, and exits.

## Startup safety

The dashboard sidebar exposes a **Startup safety** page. Its warning state is derived from active
Codex routing plus the actual service and launcher-shim installation state; the
`codexAutoStart` preference alone is never presented as proof of restart protection. The page shows
copyable repair commands (`ocx service install`, `ocx codex-shim install`, and `ocx restore`). On
Windows it can also install an owned, per-user system tray. The resident tray owns only its icon,
home-scoped singleton, and HKCU Run registration; fixed proxy actions delegate to the CLI so drain,
service conflict handling, native restore, and PID identity remain centralized. Tray presence never
makes `startup.status` protected.

Dashboard updates persist their detached worker PID before returning success. This lets a later run
distinguish a live installer from a worker that crashed. Records created by older versions do not
have a PID, so they remain exclusive for a conservative ten-minute window before automatic
recovery; operators no longer need to delete `update-job.json` after a dead worker.

```text
[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Prevent a crashed dashboard update worker from permanently blocking every later update.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The job file was written before spawn, the returned PID was not persisted, and active status had no liveness or freshness check.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Require manual deletion; expire all jobs by age; or persist PID and use age only for legacy no-PID records.
- 선택한 방식: Persist and verify PID liveness, with a ten-minute fallback only for legacy records.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It recovers known-dead workers promptly without allowing a second installer beside a long-running live worker.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: New jobs self-recover after worker death and spawn failures become visible; legacy crashes may remain blocked for up to ten minutes.
```

## UX boundary

The dashboard is a local control surface, not a separate service. It should reflect the same config
and catalog invariants documented in this folder rather than inventing parallel state.

The `/#codex-auth` add-account modal has a three-step manual-code UX contract on top of the existing
OAuth polling API: submit request, waiting-for-login completion, and terminal success/failure. Once
`POST /api/codex-auth/login/code` succeeds, the GUI must keep the input disabled, expose an
`aria-live` status message that the code was accepted, and surface repeated `login-status` polling
network failures as a visible warning instead of silently looking idle again.

## Usage accounting

`src/usage/log.ts` writes append-only JSONL to `~/.opencodex/usage.jsonl` with file mode `0o600`.
`src/usage/summary.ts` turns that file into the `/api/usage` shape — totals, daily zero-filled
grid, model and provider breakdowns, and `measured / reported / unreported / unsupported / estimated` counts.
Missing usage is never treated as zero. The dashboard Usage tab renders the same shape, and the
main Dashboard surfaces a 30d token / coverage summary. The in-memory `requestLog` is capped at
200 entries and is **not** the source of truth for aggregation — the JSONL on disk is.

The management API caches only the compact summary for an exact file revision and query; it never
retains normalized per-request rows after a response. The cache invalidates on any identity, size, or
timestamp change and at the next range expiry or local-day boundary. Rebuilds parse in bounded
batches and yield between them, so unrelated management requests remain serviceable even for a large
existing log. The Dashboard polls its 30-day usage summary independently once per minute, so usage
work cannot delay health/provider/settings state or run every five seconds.

[Decision Log]
- 목적과 의도: Keep dashboard and management requests responsive as `usage.jsonl` grows.
- 기존 구현 및 제약 조건: The JSONL file remains the durable source of truth and may be truncated, replaced, or hand-edited.
- 검토한 주요 대안: Retain normalized rows, maintain a second database, or cache only revision-keyed summaries and cooperatively rebuild them.
- 선택한 방식: Keep only bounded summary results, share full reads by exact file identity, yield during parsing, and poll usage separately at a slower cadence.
- 다른 대안 대신 이 방식을 선택한 이유: It bounds resident heap and avoids a second persistence format while keeping unrelated endpoints responsive.
- 장점, 단점 및 영향: Unchanged queries are cheap and memory stays bounded; a changed large log still consumes rebuild CPU, but cooperatively and at most once per observed revision/query.

For diagnosing upstream-shape / usage-extraction issues run `ocx debug usage on` (or set
`OPENCODEX_USAGE_DEBUG=1` before start). The proxy then writes a rolling debug record per finalized
request to `~/.opencodex/usage-debug.jsonl` (mode `0o600`, auto-trimmed to the most-recent 100 lines
once it exceeds 200) with the upstream content-type, body kind (`sse / json / other / none`), a 2KB
body sample, and the extracted usage. Off by default; the hot path is guarded so production stays
untouched.

## Provider debug logging

Provider transport diagnostics (dropped SSE frames, adapter dial/stream events, etc.) are opt-in:
`ocx debug provider on` / `ocx debug provider off` on the running proxy, the Debug-page toggle, or `OCX_DEBUG=1` on
the next start (legacy `OCX_DEBUG_FRAMES` still enables the same path). Lines
use the `[ocx:<adapter>:<event>]` prefix, go to the proxy terminal, and are buffered for
`ocx debug provider logs` / `ocx debug provider logs -f`. Usage JSONL tails with
`ocx debug usage logs [-f]`. Separate from provider buffered logs above.
