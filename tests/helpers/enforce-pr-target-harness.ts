   *
   * Round eight walked straight through the difference. `if (core.setOutput)
   * return;` and `if (core.getInput?.("github-token")) return;` are no-ops in
   * a harness whose fake `core` lacks those methods, and a complete shutdown
   * of the gate in production, where `@actions/core` has both and
   * `github-token` carries a `${{ github.token }}` default.
   *
   * Every name below is exported by `@actions/core`. Ones the script has no
   * business calling from a workflow that holds a write token — `setSecret`,
   * `addPath`, `exportVariable`, `getIDToken` — are present but throw, so the
   * probe sees production's shape while the call is still rejected. The rest
   * behave plausibly: `getInput` returns the action's real defaults,
   * `isDebug()` is false, `group` runs its callback.
