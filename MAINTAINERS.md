# Maintainers

This document lists the people responsible for maintaining openprovider and defines the project's
review and merge policy.

## Current maintainers

| GitHub account | Project role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [@lidge-jun](https://github.com/lidge-jun) | Project owner | Project direction, releases, repository administration, and final governance decisions |
| [@Ingwannu](https://github.com/Ingwannu) | Maintainer | Issue and pull-request triage, `dev` integration, security review, and repository maintenance |
| [@Wibias](https://github.com/Wibias) | Maintainer | Issue and pull-request triage, `dev` integration, and provider/CI maintenance |

The table describes project responsibilities. Actual repository permissions remain controlled
through GitHub repository settings.

## Review and merge policy

- Pull requests target `dev` by default. `dev2-go` is a parallel integration
  line reserved for Go native-port work; it converges back through
  maintainer-controlled merges, and promotion to `main` still happens only from
  `dev`. The target-branch check accepts both as integration targets. It cannot
  distinguish scoped Go port work from anything else aimed at `dev2-go`, so
  that boundary is enforced in review: redirect an out-of-scope pull request to
  `dev` rather than treating the automation's silence as approval.
- A pull request requires approval from at least one maintainer and successful required CI checks
  before merge.
- Authors do not approve their own pull requests.
- Authentication, credential handling, GitHub Actions, release automation, dependency installation,
  and other security-boundary changes require explicit security review.
- Security-sensitive and release-related changes should be reviewed by both maintainers when
  practical.
- Direct pushes are reserved for maintainer-owned integration work, urgent repairs, or incident
  recovery. The same CI and documentation requirements still apply.
- Promotion from `dev` to `main` and npm releases is maintainer-controlled.

## Maintainer changes

Adding or removing a maintainer requires:

1. agreement from the project owner,
2. review by another current maintainer when available, and
3. updates to this file and [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](./.github/CODEOWNERS).

### Change log

- 2026-07-27 — [@Wibias](https://github.com/Wibias) added as a maintainer.
  Requirement 1 (agreement from the project owner) is met: the owner requested
  the addition. **Requirement 2 (review by another current maintainer) is still
  open** and is satisfied when this change is reviewed and merged; until then
  this entry records an in-progress change, not a completed procedure.
  Requirement 3 is met by this file and `.github/CODEOWNERS`.

  Scope covers issue and pull-request triage, `dev` integration, and
  provider/CI maintenance. Security-boundary ownership in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
  is deliberately unchanged: authentication, credential handling, GitHub
  Actions, and release automation keep the two owners already listed for those
  paths, so this addition does not widen the review surface for them.

  CODEOWNERS requests reviews rather than enforcing them — no branch protection
  rule is configured on this repository, so code-owner approval is a convention
  here, not a gate. The same is true of the approval requirement in the review
  and merge policy above. Widening the security boundary, or enforcing either
  of these through branch protection, is a separate decision.

## Security reports

Private vulnerability reports are handled by the current maintainers according to
[`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md). Do not disclose secrets or exploit details in a public issue.
