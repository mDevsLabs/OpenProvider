/**
 * Central identity neutralization.
 *
 * Codex sends the SAME GPT-5 identity line to EVERY model at request time (the per-model catalog
 * `base_instructions` is ignored on the wire). For routed, non-OpenAI providers that line is both
 * wrong (the model isn't GPT-5) and a liability: the previous fix replaced it with text that
 * advertised "...served through / running via the openprovider proxy", which leaked our proxy identity
 * into the upstream payload — a signature no first-party client (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro) ever
 * sends, and a likely ToS trigger.
 *
 * The neutral replacement keeps ONLY the necessary instruction (don't misreport as GPT-5/OpenAI)
 * and names no proxy. Provider-native identity blocks (e.g. the anthropic OAuth "You are a Claude
 * agent..." prefix) are layered on TOP of this by the individual adapters; this module never claims
 * to be a specific first-party client.
