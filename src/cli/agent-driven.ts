 * Detects whether this process was started by a coding agent rather than typed

 * Agent harnesses run `opr` on the user's behalf and answer prompts from their
 * own logic, which means a consent question would be decided by the agent
 * instead of the account owner. Prompts that act on the user's identity check
 * this and defer instead: they stay silent so the question reaches the human on
 * a later hand-typed run.
 *
 * Detection is env-var based and deliberately conservative — a false positive
 * only postpones a prompt, while a false negative would let an agent answer for
 * the user.
